Hello World!

qu1nt3ss0n here, I am a finance and business professional, with experiences in banking and hedge funds.
My interests are in financial markets, project managment, operations management, data science and programming.
My ambition in life is to be an 'expert-generalist' and to solve problems using a multi-disciplinary skill-set. http://futureblind.com/2011/07/29/generalists-vs-specialists-and-the-specialists-dilemma/
